## About me

Hi, I'm Sharan K. I kicked off my programming journey with **C++** in 11th grade, and let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt exactly smooth sailing‚Äîmore like a roller coaster ride through a maze of confusion. I struggled, questioned all my life choices, and then stumbled into **C**, thinking it might be a bit more forgiving. But then, **Python** swooped in like a superhero in a cape and made everything click! I dove into basic AI, and suddenly, coding felt more like a fun puzzle than a never-ending headache. After surviving C and Python, I thought I was ready to take on the world‚Ä¶ until **Java** showed up, like that one relative who insists on showing up uninvited. But then I realized **Java** and **Scala** are basically twins‚Äîsame family, just one with a slightly cooler vibe. Scala‚Äôs modern flair won me over, and I‚Äôve been happily exploring it ever since. Over time, though, I realized that **C++** had secretly been strengthening my programming muscles all along, so I still follow it religiously. Now I'm leveling up my DSA skills on LeetCode‚Äîbecause who needs sleep anyway?
